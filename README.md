## return-to-halloween-town
A 2D RPG puzzle platformer made with Unity 2017. All scripting was done in C#, and all graphics are original.
The game itself was very inspired by the Metroidvania archetype, and does its best to imitate a game of that genre.

The HalloweenTownUnity directory contains source code for the game, to be opened in Unity.
The game itself is run with either of the finalBuilds, depending on your OS.

# Premise
On a spooky Halloween night, when you're out with friends trick-or-treating and having a good time, you suddenly find yourself wandering into an abandoned cemetary. You hear a clocktower chime in the background, and you're transported to a foreign new world...

Traverse treacherous terrains, meet quirky new characters, and gain new abilities throughout the process - all in the hopes of returning to your old home!


# Instructions
Arrow keys - Player movement.

A - Jump.

S - Intract with NPCs and progress text bubbles / Basic attack, if you have it unlocked.

QWER - Add elements to your spell queue, if you've unlocked them.

D - Dequeue the elements currently in your spell queue.

Space - Cast the spell that you currently have queued.

# Miscellaneous
This project had its tilemaps generated by Tiled map editor: http://www.mapeditor.org

Tiled maps were then moved into Unity with Tiled2Unity: http://www.seanba.com/tiled2unity

Additionally, a metroidvania camera resource that I found helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfbJ-JSrOc
